\todo{write this}

\begin{thm*}[Reynolds transport theorem]
    Let $\phi_t:M\to M$ be a smooth family of diffeomorphism generated by vector fields $X_t$, and $\eta_t$ a family of symplectic forms.
    Then:
    \[\frac{\dee}{\dee t}\left(\phi_t^*\eta_t\right)=\phi_t^*\left(\frac{\dee\eta_t}{\dee t}+L_{X_t}\eta_t\right)\]
\end{thm*}

\subsubsection*{Moser's trick and its consequences}
\begin{thm}[Moser's trick]
    Let $M$ be a closed smooth even-dimensional manifold.
    Let $(\omega_t)_{t\in[0,1]}$ be a family of symplectic forms on $M$ and $(\sigma_t)_{t\in[0,1]}$ a family of smooth $1$-forms such that
    \[\frac\dee{\dee t}\omega_t=\dee\sigma_t.\]
    Then there exists a family $(\psi_t)_{t\in[0,1]}$ of diffeomorphisms on $M$ satisfying
    \[\psi_t^*\omega_t=\omega_0.\]
\end{thm}

For the next results we need the following "technical lemma".
\begin{lem}
    Let $M$ be a smooth $2n$-manifold, $Q\subset M$ a closed submanifold, and $\omega_0,\omega_1\in\Omega^2(M)$ closed forms such that for all points $q\in Q$, $\omega_{0,q}$ and $\omega_{1,q}$ are non-degenerate and agree on all of $T_qM$.
\end{lem}

\subsubsection*{Consequences of Moser's trick}
\todo{short bit on Darboux's theorem}

\begin{thm*}[Darboux]
    Let $(M,\omega)$ be a symplectic $2n$-manifold.
    Then for all points $p\in M$, there exists some neighborhood $U\ni p$ such that $(U,\omega|_U)$ is symplectomorphic to an open subset 
$V\subset\bR^{2n}$ equipped with the canonical symplectic form.
\end{thm*}

\begin{proof}
    \todo{prove this}
\end{proof}

\begin{thm*}[Moser's stability theorem]
    Let $M$ be a closed manifold, and $(\omega_t)_{t\in[0,1]}$ a smooth family of symplectic forms such that $[\omega_t]\in H^2_{\mathrm{dR}}(M,\bR)$ is fixed independently of $t$.
    Then there exists a family of diffeomorphism $(\psi_t)_{t\in[0,1]}$ such that
    \[\psi_t^*\omega_t=\omega_0.\]
\end{thm*}

\begin{proof}
    \todo{prove this}
\end{proof}

\begin{dfn}
    We say that a smooth submanifold $Q\subset(M,\omega)$ is symplectic, (co)isotropic, or Lagrangian if for all $q\in Q$ the tangent space $T_qQ\subset T_qM$ satisfies the corresponding property with respect to $\omega$.
\end{dfn}

Recall specifically that $T_qQ\subset T_qM$ is Lagrangian if $(T_qQ)^\omega=T_qQ$ or equivalently if $\dim Q=\dim M/2$ and $\omega_q|_{T_qQ}=0$.

\begin{example}[$T^*L,\omega_{\mathrm{can}}$]
    As previously discussed, for a manifold $L$ the cotangent bundle and canonical form give a symplectic manifold $(T^*L,\omega_{\mathrm{can}})$.
    Now the zero section $L\subset T^*L$ and the cotangent space $T_q^*L\subset T^*L$ are Lagrangian submanifolds.
    \todo{tikz this}
\end{example}

In fact we will next show that any closed Lagrangian submanifold is locally like $T^*L$.

\begin{thm*}[Weinstein neighborhood theorem]
    Let $L^n\subset(M^{2n},\omega)$ be a Lagrangian submanifold.
    Then there exist open sets
    \[L\subset U\subset M\quad\text{and}\quad L\subset V\subset T^*L,\]
    and a symplectomorphism $\phi:(V,\omega_{\mathrm{can}})\to(U,\omega|_U)$ such that $\phi|_L=\id_L$.
\end{thm*}
